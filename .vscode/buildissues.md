# Build Issues Log

## Issue 6: WatchDataPresenter Initialization Context
- **File**: `WatchDataPresenter.swift`
- **Status**: Fixed ✅
- **Original Error**: Call to main actor-isolated initializer in synchronous nonisolated context
- **Solution**: 
  1. Made initializer private and synchronous
  2. Added static factory method
  3. Removed default parameter

### Changes Made
1. Initialization:
   - [x] Made init private and synchronous
   - [x] Added static create() factory method
   - [x] Removed default parameter

2. Usage:
   - [x] Checked all files for WatchDataPresenter usage
   - [x] No direct instantiations found
   - [x] Ready for future usage with factory method

### Next Steps
1. Test build
2. Document factory method usage
3. Add to ContentView if needed

## Issue 7: Watch Widget Not Visible
- **Problem**: Widget not appearing in watchOS complications
- **Potential Causes**:
  1. Widget families configuration
  2. Info.plist setup
  3. Extension bundle configuration

### Investigation Steps
1. Widget Configuration:
   - [x] Check supported families
   - [ ] Add more complication types
   - [ ] Verify widget kind identifier

2. Info.plist:
   - [ ] Verify widget extension setup
   - [ ] Check bundle identifier
   - [ ] Add necessary watchOS keys

3. Project Setup:
   - [ ] Verify target membership
   - [ ] Check deployment target
   - [ ] Verify extension embedding

### Next Steps
1. Update widget configuration:
   ```swift
   .supportedFamilies([
       .accessoryCircular,
       .accessoryRectangular,
       .accessoryInline
   ])
   ```
2. Update Info.plist
3. Verify extension bundle settings

## Issue 8: Data Sharing and Background Refresh
- **Problem**: Widget shows "Open iPhone app to load weather"
- **Potential Causes**:
  1. App group entitlements not set
  2. Background refresh not scheduled
  3. Data not being saved to UserDefaults

### Investigation Steps
1. App Group Setup:
   - [ ] Add app group entitlement to iOS app
   - [ ] Add app group entitlement to watch widget
   - [ ] Verify group name matches: "group.generouscorp.SS2.ggbweather"

2. Background Refresh:
   - [ ] Schedule refresh on app launch
   - [ ] Add background fetch capability
   - [ ] Test background refresh timing

3. Data Verification:
   - [ ] Add logging to saveWeatherData
   - [ ] Add logging to loadWeatherData
   - [ ] Verify data persistence

### Next Steps
1. Add entitlements files
2. Update background refresh scheduling
3. Add debug logging
4. Test data flow

## Issue 9: Missing App Groups Capability
- **Problem**: App groups not enabled in target capabilities
- **Required For**:
  1. iOS app target
  2. Watch widget extension target
  3. iOS widget extension target

### Fix Steps
1. In Xcode:
   - [ ] Select each target
   - [ ] Go to Signing & Capabilities
   - [ ] Click + button
   - [ ] Add "App Groups" capability
   - [ ] Add group: "group.generouscorp.SS2.ggbweather"

2. Verify Setup:
   - [ ] Check entitlements files are generated
   - [ ] Verify group name matches in all targets
   - [ ] Rebuild and test data sharing

### Next Steps
1. Add App Groups capability to all targets
2. Clean build
3. Test data flow
4. Check logs

## Previous Issues
### ✅ Issue 5: WatchDataPresenter Actor and Closure Issues (FIXED)
- Fixed self references
- Fixed error property
- Fixed initialization

### ⏳ Issue 4: Remaining Type Resolution Issues
- **Status**: In Progress
- Removed SS2 typealias
- Added explicit type annotations
- Need to verify build

### ✅ Issue 3: Codable and Type Resolution (FIXED)
- Moved WeatherData Codable conformance to WeatherModels.swift
- Added explicit type annotations for nil values
- Added Entry typealias to TimelineProvider

### ✅ Issue 2: WeatherData Conflicts (FIXED)
- Removed duplicate WeatherData struct
- Added proper imports
- Fixed target membership

### ✅ Issue 1: Missing SharedDataInteractorProtocol (FIXED)
- Added SharedCacheModels.swift and SharedDataInteractor.swift
- Updated target membership
- Fixed target naming

## Action Items
- [x] Fix WatchDataPresenter initialization
- [x] Create factory method
- [x] Check all usage points
- [ ] Test build after changes
- [ ] Add more supported widget families
- [ ] Update Info.plist configuration
- [ ] Verify extension bundle setup
- [ ] Test widget visibility
- [ ] Create entitlements files
- [ ] Add app group capability
- [ ] Update background refresh
- [ ] Add debug logging
- [ ] Test data persistence
- [ ] Enable App Groups in Xcode
- [ ] Verify entitlements
- [ ] Test data sharing
- [ ] Check logs

## Notes
- WatchDataPresenter now uses factory pattern
- Initialization is synchronous and safe
- No existing instantiations to update
- Ready for use in future views
- Watch widgets need specific complication types
- Consider adding all supported watch face types
- May need to update deployment target
- Check widget embedding in watch app
- App group must match in all targets
- Background refresh needs proper scheduling
- Need to verify data flow
- Consider adding more debug info
- App Groups capability is required for UserDefaults sharing
- Must match "group.generouscorp.SS2.ggbweather" exactly
- Need to enable in ALL targets that share data
- Clean build after adding capabilities
